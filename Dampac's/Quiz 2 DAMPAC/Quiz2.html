        <h1>The Child From Cotabato City</h1>

        <h2>Life</h2>

        <p>
            Hello! I am Mohaimen Dampac but I do much prefer being called as Idan (EEDAN). I was born in Davao City but was raised in Digos for 3 years. My dad wanted to sell our house for a long time so after it got sold, we then eventually moved to Cotabato City where we stayed there till I was in Grade 4 in Notre Dame of Cotabato Elementary School. When I hit Grade 5, we moved back to Davao City where we pretty much just settled down. My Parents enrolled me to Davao Chong Hua High School back then was known as Davao Central High School where I graduated Elementary and High School. My time there was a roller coaster, it was fun the first few years but the latter years didn't end so well so I enrolled to University of Mindanao where I finished Senior High and after that I immediately enrolled to Malayan Colleges Mindanao to pursue a career in Programming.

        <h2>Spare Time</h2>

        <p>
            On my spare time, I like to take care of my body first and I'll always prioritize that. I would go to the gym daily and if I'm in the mood, I would go for an early morning jog. When I'm finished with taking care of my body, I would just sit in front of my computer and play video games or watch any movie or series till I'm done with the day. I used to be a DotA player and was on my way to becoming a professional esport player but sadly, it didn't happen because of my dad was not supportive of it so I stopped playing and would only play if a friend of mine would invite me for a couple of games.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

        <p>
            My hobby is using the computer because ever since I was 10 years old, I was already infront of the monitor playing Vice City, GTA San Andreas, etc. Right now, I would either play games, watch anything that interests me or do coding till I'm tired enough to go to bed and sleep. Other than that, the things that I would do with the exception of being infront of the computer would just highly depend on the day if there is an occasion that I got invited to which I would go or have a family bonding. The truth is I don't really go out that much hahaha! It takes a lot for me to go out and have fun that's why I would much prefer to be in the house and just do my thing.

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p>
            Honestly, I'm not really interested in attending school because ever since high school, my goal was to be a professional esport DotA player and lift The International Aegis/Trophy. I'm a very competitive person and having to transition my goal to something else is still really hard for me and when I finally reached college that's when I decided that I would be a programmer. Thirty years from now, I think I would be that rich old man from a countryside in Japan or anywhere in the Philippines, holding a coffee mug watching a great view from a far and just chill together with my family.
