      <h3>1. Machu Picchu</h3>
	<img src="images/matchu_picchu.jpg" width="720" />
    <p>With its famous rocky outcrops, towering surrounding hills, cloud forests and mortarless stone structures, Machu Picchu is possibly the most famous Inca settlement in South America. Machu Picchu is a citadel filled with plazas, palaces and temples, and sits on a high ridge above the Urubamba River.</p>
	  
	<p>Whilst the main draw of Machu Picchu is the settlement itself, a short but challenging walk away is the Temple of the Moon. The temple is a cave-shrine filled with beautiful stonework and was believed to be used to house mummies. Head to the hidden Museo de Sitio Manuel Chaves Ballon to learn more about why this incredible ancient site was built.</p>
	
    <h3>2. Nazca Lines</h3>

	<p>Following this first phase of development, what we now acknowledge as the first regional empire emerged, around 550 AD. Known as Wari, and a continuation of the Peruvian and Bolivian high plains Tiahuanaco culture, this society dominated a vast territory across much of the area that would later become the Inca empire of Tahuantinsuyo. It was the Wari who first began to lay out the great pre-Hispanic highway network and establish the social and territorial administrative system that would eventually be inherited by the Incas of Cusco. With the disappearance of Wari, around 1 200 AD, the Late Intermediate period began, in the form of a second wave of regional cultural developments, among which the Chimu are particularly worthy of note, as the builders of Chan Chan, the world’s largest mud brick city. The Chachapoyas also emerged at this time, the so-called “people of the clouds”, who occupied the luxuriant cloud forests of the Amazonas region, where they built extraordinary cities and mausoleums carved into sheer cliffs. </p>

    <h3>3. Caral</h3>

	<p>Developing at the same time as other great ancient civilisations such as Egypt and Mesopotamia, Caral is a 5000-year-old sacred city that is not to be missed when visiting Peru. The city is located in the Supe Valley, where the land was fertile and the sea was close by, allowing for the civilisation to flourish. Much of the remaining buildings were made from mud bricks, which were used to create circular plazas and even pyramids, of which there were once six. Whilst visiting the site, look out for the archeological finds unearthed during digs at Caral which include bone flutes and quipus, a method of tying knots to record information.</p>

    <h3>4. Colca Canyon</h3>

	<p>Often bypassed by tourists for the Inca landmarks of Peru, Colca Canyon is a breathtaking sight to behold. Notoriously difficult to get to, the canyon is part of the Andes and is very remote, with the nearest major city being over 160km away. The canyon, for those that brave the journey, is twice as deep as the Grand Canyon in America and winds its way through the Andes along the river. The canyon is one of the best locations to spot the Andean Condor, the largest flying bird on Earth.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Lake Titicaca</h3>
    <img src="images/lake_titicaca.jpg" width="720" />
	<p>Lake Titicaca is the highest navigable body of water in the world, at 3800 meters above sea level. The lake sits along the border of Peru and Bolivia. Due to its altitude, there are many spectacular species of wildlife to look out for, including Chilean pink flamingos. Surrounding the lake are many ancient architectural sites of civilisations who relied on the lake and its waters for sustenance. The lake, like many natural sites in Peru, is home to numerous myths and legends.</p>
